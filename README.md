# Feature selection and extraction

Introduction:

If you have a large data set, you can use filtering methods to perform feature
selection to minimize the number of features. In this homework, you will learn
to the following for feature selection:


<br>
* Variance thresholding.<br>
* Correlation.<br>
* Chi-square test.<br>
* Generate predictions from the model.<br>
<br>
You will also learn to extract features and reduce the amount of data you need
in your machine learning pipeline using Principal Component Analysis (PCA ).
